      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re looking to expand our buddy pool with buddies from all divisions! This is your chance to improve a new PhD studentâ€™s experience, by helping them figure out everything you wish you had known when you started here!
Do you have some wise advice or useful tips you wish someone had given you at the start of your PhD journey?
This could be anything from questions about navigating department bureaucracy, advice on apartment hunting in Gothenburg, tips on socializing in a new city/country, etc.</description>
