<p>The first days when you start your PhD in an unknown place can be a bit disorienting or overwhelming, so here is a (possibly incomplete) checklist of things you should keep in mind for your first days around. (If you find out there&rsquo;s information that should be included or updated, please send us a mail!)</p>

<p>Also, if you come from another country you should also read the <a href="posts/new-in-sweden.md">New in Sweden</a> page to get an idea of things you should take care of when you arrive.</p>

<h3 id="your-first-day">Your first day</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Office</strong>: you should have been assigned an office (possibly shared with other people) that will serve as your workplace. You should get a label with your name on the door too, so make sure to ask for that.</li>
<li><strong>Key</strong>: You should get the key for your office. In the EDIT building (Johanneberg campus) this key will also open the mail room.</li>
<li><strong>Keycard</strong>: Outside doors, lab doors, and some other doors, are locked with an electronic system for which you need a keycard. To get it yo get that you have to go to the library (in Johanneberg). There they will take a picture of you, set whatever pin-code you want, and print your card. If all goes well you will have your card right away (Otherwise it might take a few days). <strong>Once you have your card</strong> go back to your administrative officer so they can give you access to the appropriate locations.</li>
<li><strong>Workstation</strong>: You might have already ordered it (and hopefully already have it), or you might have to do that now. Talk to your supervisor or your manager if this is the case, and you will probably be directed to <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/staff/Pages/michael-morin.aspx">Michael Morin</a> to order it or set it up. There is software you might need <a href="posts/software">available</a>. You can also <a href="posts/email">access</a> your e-mail.</li>
<li><strong>Phone</strong>: You should also be provided with a company phone with a SIM card. You will probably be able to choose between an iPhone and a Samsung phone (although you might be able to get something else if you ask). The SIM card is paid by Chalmers/GU, it&rsquo;s intended for you to use for work, but you can also use it for private stuff, <em>within reason</em>. This SIM has two phone numbers assigned to it: the usual mobile phone (07&hellip;) and a landline (031&hellip;). It&rsquo;s recommended that you give the mobile phone number to people, since the other one won&rsquo;t receive SMS appropriately.</li>
<li><strong>Single Sign-On (SSO)</strong>: You should get a username (some combination of you name and surname(s)) and a scratch-card with passwords that will let you log-in to most of the Chalmers online services. You can (and should) change your password at <a href="https://pdb.chalmers.se">PersonDataBas</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Mailing Lists</strong>: Your administrative officer should add you (or tell you who to ask) to the department (all.cse [at] chalmers.se) and division mailing lists, as well as the department&rsquo;s PhD students mailing list (phd.cse [at] chalmers.se).</li>
<li><strong>Talk with your Manager</strong>: They will probably want to meet you too and have the introductory meeting.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Information and Profiles</strong>: You should update your personal information and point of contact (next of kin, etc) at <a href="https://personal.portal.chalmers.se/chalmers/">Primula</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Join the Student Union</strong>: It is <strong>mandatory</strong> that PhD students be part of the student union. <a href="posts/student-union">Find information here</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="organisational-structure-at-cse">Organisational Structure at CSE</h3>

<p>These are the people that are in charge of you, in one way or another. You should find out who each one of them is.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Supervisor</strong>: (possibly together with a co-supervisor) is the person who will overview your research, and who you should go to for any research-related issues.</li>
<li><strong>Examiner</strong>: Is the person who will act as your examiner during your PhD; they evaluate your progress and decide if a course you want to attend will count towards your PhD credits, so ask them about that before choosing to join a course.</li>
<li><strong>Line Manager</strong>: It is usually the head of your division or the head of your unit (in some divisions). They are responsible for <em>work</em> related issues, such as work environment, yearly appraisal meetings to check that you are able to do your job, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Director of Studies</strong>: This is the person that manages the courses in your division, and who will distribute the teaching hours for each one.</li>
<li><strong>Head of PhD School</strong>: They are in charge of PhDs education in the department. Currently the position is held by <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/staff/Pages/agneta-nilsson.aspx">Agneta Nilsson</a></li>
<li><strong>Head of Division</strong>: The person who manages your specific division.</li>
<li><strong>Head of Department</strong>: They are responsible for the whole CSE department. Currently the position is held by <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/staff/Pages/charlotte-wiberg.aspx">Charlotte Wiberg</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="your-first-weeks">Your first weeks</h3>

<p>Things you should take into account to start planning for them as soon as possible:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Study Plan</strong>: You <strong>must</strong> have prepared a study plan and sent it <a href="https://intranet.chalmers.se/en/tools-support/doctoral-studies-support/during-your-doctoral-studies/follow-up-meetings-and-individual-study-plan-and-follow-up-meetings/#individual-study-plan-and-follow-up-meetings-at-computer-science-and-engineering">following the guidelines</a> after <strong>2 months</strong> of starting your PhD.</li>
<li><strong>Follow-Up Meeting</strong>: Around <strong>six months</strong> after starting your PhD you should have your first <em>follow-up meeting</em>. You have to schedule it yourself with enough time. <a href="https://intranet.chalmers.se/en/tools-support/doctoral-studies-support/during-your-doctoral-studies/follow-up-meetings-and-individual-study-plan-and-follow-up-meetings/#individual-study-plan-and-follow-up-meetings-at-computer-science-and-engineering">Find the guidelines for that in this link</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Departamental Work</strong>: For most PhD students, one fifth of their total PhD time will be spent on departamental work, which usually means teaching. Talk with the <em>Director of Studies</em> of your division as soon as possible so they can assign you work. Otherwise you will have to catch-up later.</li>
<li><strong>GTS Courses</strong>: PhD students at Chalmers must have gotten 60 course credits by the end of the PhD, 15 of which have to be from GTS (Generic and Transferable Skills) courses. Among the ones offered, there are several that are mandatory. <a href="https://student.portal.chalmers.se/doctoralportal/gts/Pages/default.aspx">Check them out</a> and start planning for them as soon as possible. One of them is a &ldquo;General introduction for doctoral students&rdquo; which will give you some more information you will need about other GTS courses and about your PhD in general.</li>
